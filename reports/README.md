# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the
curriculum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked all boxes at the end of the project.
The parenthesis at the end indicates what module the bullet point is related to. Please be honest in your answers, we
will check the repositories and the code to verify your answers.

### Question 3
> **A requirement to the project is that you include a third-party package not covered in the course. What framework**
> **did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

--- In our project, we have implemented a sweep configuration file for hyperparameter optimization using the third-party framework Weights and Biases. We used functionality such as sweep configuration and hyperparameter tuning from the package to define and run a sweep efficiently in our project.

The sweep setup uses the Bayesian optimization method, with predefined metrics such as validation loss and a goal to minimize it. The YAML configuration file includes a list of hyperparameters and their respective ranges or values, such as the number of epochs and various batch sizes, which will be explored during the training process.

When the training starts, the sweep launches instances locally and runs training with different combinations of hyperparameters. These runs communicate with the Weights and Biases server, which adjusts the hyperparameters between runs based on the optimization method. Finally, the sweep produces graphical representations of the training configurations alongside the corresponding validation accuracy, allowing us to analyze the performance of the models under different setups. ---

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
> how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

--- We used a requirements.txt file to manage our dependencies. The list of dependencies has been continually updated during development. To get a complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands: <br>`git clone https://github.com/thomas-tams/mlops_02476_project.git`
<br>`cd mlops_02476_project`
<br>`conda create -n py39_mlops python=3.9`
<br>`conda activate py39_mlops`
<br>`pip install -e .["dev"]` 
<br>`pre-commit install`

Another smart way to get a copy of the development environment is by using *invoke*. With *conda* and *invoke* a new team member may set up a development environment through these commands invoke in the base conda environment:
<br>`git clone https://github.com/thomas-tams/mlops_02476_project.git`
<br>`cd mlops_02476_tcs`
<br>`invoke create-environment`
<br>`conda activate mlops_project_tcs`
<br>`pip install invoke # Again in the new conda env`
<br>`invoke dev-requirements`
<br>`pre-commit install`

If the new developer needs to work with docker and Google Cloud, then you would have to install *gcloud* for the operating system and write your project's wandb_api.txt as well as getting a Google Cloud service API key with bucket admin permissions which you have to write to a file called bucket_manager.json. ---

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
>
> Answer:

--- From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the *.github*, *configs*, *data*, *dockerfiles*, *docs*, *models*, *reports*, *src*, *tests* folders:
- The *.github* folder keeps the workflow .yaml files.
- In the *data* folder, we have created a subfolder structure containing different processed and augmented data folders such as *balanced*, *processed*, *raw*, *split*, *split_augmented*.
- In *configs* is a .json file with class labels.
- *dockerfiles* has our base .dockerfile together with gcloud .dockerfiles for API and FastAPI frontend.
- In the *docs* folder, we have app documentation and the mkdocs.yaml to create the README.md file.
- In *models* we keep the best performing model.ckpt checkpoint from the most recent training run.
- *reports* contains our project hand-in report and script for creating .html rendition.
- In the *src* folder we have the project source code in *mlops_project_tcs* (tcs = Thomas, Casper, Sven). This contains .py scripts such as *data.py*, *train.py* and others for driving the project.
- *test* contains unit tests.

We have removed the *notebooks* folder as we did note use any jupyter notebooks.

We have added *.dvc* to accomodate data version control containing the necessary configurations. ---

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,**
> **explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These*
> *concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...*
>
> Answer:

--- In order to ensure code quality and format, we have made use of the *Ruff* Python linter. In our source code functions, we have improved the quality of our code by applying *typing* to make it easier to directly read the types of input variables and returns. Additionally, docstrings and comments have been added to the code to enable more readily understandable logic. For a project like ours where more developers are envolved, this is essential. For example, the docstrings gives a quick overview of parameters, arguments and returns. Furthermore, with *Ruff* integrated into our GitHub workflows, we make sure to continually check and format the source code as it is updated and developed. ---

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

--- In total, we have implemented three test .py scripts:
- *test_data_processing.py* tests the data preprocessing pipeline and whether the data is available and has the correct format.
- *test_model.py* tests that the model produces the correct output format (number of output classes).
- *test_train.py* creates a dummy dataset and test whether the trainer, hydra config files, wanb logger and initialization works correctly to run a training of the model. ---

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

--- In our project, the total code coverage of the tests is 51%, encompassing most of our source code. We acknowledge that this figure is significantly below 100%. However, as emphasized in the course, achieving 100% code coverage does not guarantee that the code is error-free. This is because the unit tests themselves might not adequately test the underlying functionality or edge cases. Consequently, high code coverage can create a false sense of confidence in the correctness of the code. While code coverage provides an estimate of how much of the code is being tested, it does not measure the quality or completeness of the tests. Therefore, developing robust and meaningful unit tests is equally important and should complement code coverage metrics. ---

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

Our workflow made use of both branches and pull requests. We used branches to implement new features, without effecting the main codebase. This allowed us to work on multiple task at the same time, without running the risk of ruining our code. Each feature could thus be developed and tested in a vacuum, allowing us to run tests before merging with the main branch.
By using pull requests all team members had the ability to review surgested changes and merge them into the main branch. Having this step in the process enabled us to more easily discuss potential changes, befor actually implementing them. This meant that it was easier to ensure that the code lived up to the projects standards.

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

--- The data used in our project consists of MRI brain scan images, which we refer to as "raw data." We have utilized DVC (Data Version Control) exclusively for managing our raw data. This has been implemented by using a publicly accessible bucket in Google Cloud. While this approach hasn't been strictly necessary for our project—since the data originates from a Kaggle challenge with a fixed dataset—we anticipated that it could be a valuable feature if the project's scope were to expand. In such a case, a more comprehensive dataset might become available, and DVC would enable us to track and manage different versions of the brain scan dataset effectively. ---

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continuous integration setup. What kind of continuous integration are you running (unittesting,**
> **linting, etc.)? Do you test multiple operating systems, Python  version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free**
> **to insert a link to one of your GitHub actions workflow.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.
>
> Example:
> *We have organized our continuous integration into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing*
> *and one for running ... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen*
> *here: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

--- 
We have implemented continuous integration for various parts of our project. Using pre-commit hooks, we ensure that workflows perform specific checks both locally during commits and in GitHub Actions. As mentioned earlier, we also run unit tests on our code in GitHub Actions to ensure that any flaws in updated code, which may not be detected locally during development, are identified and addressed. Additionally, we use Ruff as a pre-commit tool for linting.

As an example of our continuous integration setup, we invite you to review one of our GitHub Actions workflows. This workflow ensures that when branches are merged into the main branch or commits are pushed to the main branch, dependencies are installed, and pytest is executed. In the post-build stage (which runs only if the matrix build completes successfully), an updated Dockerfile for the project is sent to Google Cloud, where an updated image is built. This approach ensures that changes made to the project on GitHub are reflected in the Docker image, which users rely on when running the project code: https://github.com/thomas-tams/mlops_02476_project/blob/main/.github/workflows/tests.yaml
