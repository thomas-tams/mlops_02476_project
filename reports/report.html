<p>This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:</p>
<p><code>--- question 1 fill here ---</code></p>
<p>Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the <code>figures</code> subfolder (please only use <code>.png</code>, <code>.jpg</code> or <code>.jpeg</code>) and then add the following code in your answer:</p>
<p><code>markdown
![my_image](figures/&lt;image&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;)</code></p>
<p>In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the <code>report.py</code> script that provides two utility functions:</p>
<p>Running:</p>
<p><code>bash
python report.py html</code></p>
<p>Will generate a <code>.html</code> page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this <code>reports</code> folder and then use this utility to generate a <code>.html</code> page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.</p>
<p>Running</p>
<p><code>bash
python report.py check</code></p>
<p>Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with</p>
<p><code>bash
pip install typer markdown</code></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Our workflow made use of both branches and pull requests. We used branches to implement new features, without effecting the main codebase. This allowed us to work on multiple task at the same time, without running the risk of ruining our code. Each feature could thus be developed and tested in a vacuum, allowing us to run tests before merging with the main branch.
By using pull requests all team members had the ability to review surgested changes and merge them into the main branch. Having this step in the process enabled us to more easily discuss potential changes, befor actually implementing them. This meant that it was easier to ensure that the code lived up to the projects standards.</p>
